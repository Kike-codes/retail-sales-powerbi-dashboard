Visuals included:

1. Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)

3. Category Performance
4. Discount vs Profitability Scatter Analysis

 **Discount Impact Analysis**

A scatter chart was built to show:

X-Axis → Discount

Y-Axis → Profit

Size → Sales

Legend → Sub-Category

This visualization highlights the relationship between discount levels and profitability, helping identify areas where aggressive discounting may be hurting margins.

 **Key Insights**
 
Higher discount levels tend to reduce profitability in several sub-categories.
The East region shows stronger sales performance compared to other regions.
Some categories generate revenue but operate at negative margins.
Profit margin requires strategic discount optimization.

 **Data Model**
 
A proper star schema model was implemented:

Fact Table: Sales
Dimension Table: Date
One-to-Many relationships
Cleaned and structured for accurate time intelligence
